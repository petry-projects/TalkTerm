# (petry-projects/.github standards/workflows/pr-review.yml): NO stub-level
# `concurrency:` block — the engine owns concurrency, and the template forbids
# one (#533) — AND a review-job guard that skips Dependabot-triggered runs
# (#465). Dependabot events read the separate Dependabot secret store, so
# `secrets: inherit` forwards empty PAT/OAuth secrets and the reusable's
# auth-scope check fails; skipping the job makes those runs neutral instead of
# failed.
# No bats dependency: the guard is driven as a subprocess against temporary
# fixture workflows.

#
# AGENTS — READ BEFORE EDITING:
#   • This file is a THIN CALLER STUB. All review logic lives in the engine
#     above, including concurrency (per PR + head SHA, never cancelling an
#     in-flight review), the check_suite-without-a-PR skip, and reading
#     `client_payload.pr_url` from repository_dispatch.
#   • You MUST NOT change: the `@pr-review/v1-stable` channel in the `uses:`
#     line or the matching `agent_ref` — both are re-pinned in lockstep to this
#     repo's canary-ring tier by the standards sweep. Nor the workflow `name:`,
#     the job id `review` (check names depend on both), the trigger event types,
#     the Dependabot skip guard, or the job-level `permissions:` block. Do not
#     add a stub-level `concurrency:` block.
#   • The standards sweep only REPLACES an existing caller with this file; it
#     never adds it to a repo that has none, and never touches
#     petry-projects/.github-private (whose pr-review.yml is the engine).
#   • If you need different behaviour, open a PR against the engine in
#     petry-projects/.github-private. It reaches every repo when the channel
#     tag is promoted.
