# a head-SHA concurrency lane with cancel-in-progress: false (#374) AND a
# review-job guard that skips Dependabot-triggered runs (#465). Dependabot
# events read the separate Dependabot secret store, so `secrets: inherit`
# forwards empty PAT/OAuth secrets and the reusable's auth-scope check fails;
# skipping the job makes those runs neutral instead of failed.
# No bats dependency: the guard is driven as a subprocess against temporary
# fixture workflows.
