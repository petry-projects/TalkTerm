# Regression guard: assert that dependency-audit.yml keeps the centrally-owned
# invariants its own header marks as MUST-NOT-CHANGE. The file is a thin caller
# stub for the org reusable
# petry-projects/.github/.github/workflows/dependency-audit-reusable.yml; the
# ecosystem-detection and audit logic lives there, not here.
#
# Context (compliance audit #519): the stub's `on:` surface drifted from the
# canonical standards/workflows/dependency-audit.yml — the `merge_group` trigger
# was dropped. `merge_group` is part of the standard trigger set: it is required
# so this stub's `dependency-audit / Detect ecosystems` check reports on a merge
# queue's `gh-readonly-queue/*` ref. Losing it silently removes the required
# status check from merge-queue runs. The `on:` triggers, `permissions:` grant,
# and job name are owned centrally and are not repo-adjustable; only the
# documented tier channel pin on the `uses:` ref may differ per repo. This guard
# locks the centrally-owned surface in, mirroring the sibling Fleet Monitor
# guards (test-dependabot-rebase-workflow.sh, test-pr-review-workflow.sh #374,
# test-ci-workflow.sh #380).
