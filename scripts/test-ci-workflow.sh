# Regression guard for ci.yml. Locks durable invariants whose loss inflates the
# Fleet Monitor failure rate:
#
#   1. (#380) ci.yml serializes redundant runs per Git ref via a top-level
#      `concurrency:` block. Without one, a bot pushing several commits to a PR
#      branch in quick succession fans out redundant runs that pile up as
#      `action_required`. Mirrors every sibling caller (pr-review.yml,
#      ci-failure-analyst.yml, add-to-project.yml, ...). See Checks 2-4.
#   2. (#430) any `Install yq` step extracts the SHA-256 from the mikefarah/yq
#      `checksums` release asset correctly (filename anchored at line start,
#      column 19). The buggy end-anchored / column-1 extraction produced an empty
#      checksum and a deterministic `sha256sum: no properly formatted checksum
#      lines found` failure that degraded CI. See Check 5.
#   3. (#438) every `curl` download retries on transient network failures
#      (`--retry`), so a DNS/connection blip is absorbed rather than failing CI
#      deterministically. See Check 6.
#   4. (#470) every job declares a positive-integer `timeout-minutes`, so a
#      stalled step fails fast instead of inheriting GitHub's 6-hour default and
#      landing as a timeout failure. See Check 7.
#   5. (#474) any `gitleaks detect` enforcement step loads a committed `--config`
#      whose file exists. Path-based allowlists in that config suppress reviewed
#      false positives independently of the commit SHA; without it, suppression
#      falls back to `.gitleaksignore` commit-SHA fingerprints, so a reviewed
#      false positive reappears under a fresh SHA on every commit touching the
#      file and fails CI deterministically until hand-suppressed. See Check 8.
#   6. (#486) every job declaring a `strategy.matrix` sets `strategy.fail-fast:
#      false`. With fail-fast enabled (GitHub's default when it is absent) the
#      first failing matrix leg cancels its siblings, which land as cancelled
#      runs and discard the other OSes' results — inflating the Fleet Monitor
#      cancelled/failure metrics and hiding per-OS signal. See Check 9.
#
# Accepts an optional workflow path (default: .github/workflows/ci.yml) so the
# checks can be exercised against fixtures — see test-ci-workflow.test.sh.
