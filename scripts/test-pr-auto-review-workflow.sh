# Regression guard for pr-auto-review.yml. Locks the Dependabot-resilience
# invariant whose loss inflates the Fleet Monitor failure rate (#466):
#
#   pr-auto-review.yml is a thin caller stub that hands GH_PAT_WORKFLOWS to the
#   org reusable. Dependabot-triggered `pull_request` events, however, run against
#   the Dependabot secret store where that PAT is unavailable, so the secret
#   arrives empty and the reusable's authenticated checkout / gh calls fail at
#   startup with "Input required and not supplied: token". That event can NEVER
#   succeed, and a reusable cannot rescue a run it was handed no secret for — so
#   the caller MUST skip it with a job-level `if:` guard. Readiness for Dependabot
#   PRs is still evaluated via workflow_run (CI green) and check_suite, which run
#   in the base-repo context with full secrets. If that guard silently drifts
#   away, every Dependabot PR turns a green build red again and the workflow
#   degrades. This guard fails the build the moment that happens.
#
# It also asserts the thin-caller reusable ref stays intact so the stub keeps
# delegating to the org-level pr-auto-review reusable.
#
# Accepts an optional workflow path (default: .github/workflows/pr-auto-review.yml)
# so the checks can be exercised against fixtures — see
# test-pr-auto-review-workflow.test.sh.
# Run: bash scripts/test-pr-auto-review-workflow.sh
