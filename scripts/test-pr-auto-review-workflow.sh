# Regression guard for pr-auto-review.yml. Locks the event-dependent concurrency
# contract of the thin caller stub (issues #1126, #508) so a future edit cannot
# silently change its deduplication or cancellation behaviour. The stub is synced
# verbatim from petry-projects/.github/standards/workflows/pr-auto-review.yml, so
# this guard enforces the canonical policy:
#
#   The stub fans out on check_suite / workflow_run / pull_request(_review). To
#   stay under GitHub Free's org-wide concurrency cap it collapses the
#   default-branch-context events (check_suite / workflow_run) onto one group per
#   PR with cancel-in-progress: true, while pull_request events keep a
#   unique-per-run group that never cancels. Invariants:
#
#     1. Per-PR deduplication — each of the check_suite and workflow_run branches
#        of the group is keyed on its own event's pull_requests[0].number. Stricter
#        forms that also add head_sha and/or a pull_requests[1] guard are accepted.
#     2. No-PR unique fallback — an event with no associated PR falls back to a
#        run-unique group (github.run_id) so unrelated work never collapses into
#        one cancelable group.
#
#   It also asserts cancel-in-progress stays gated on the check_suite / workflow_run
#   events (never unconditional), so pull_request-head runs are never cancelled.
#
# Accepts an optional workflow path (default: .github/workflows/pr-auto-review.yml)
# so the checks can be exercised against fixtures — see
# test-pr-auto-review-workflow.test.sh.
# Run: bash scripts/test-pr-auto-review-workflow.sh
