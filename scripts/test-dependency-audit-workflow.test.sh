# test-dependency-audit-workflow.test.sh — portable tests for the
# dependency-audit.yml regression guard (scripts/test-dependency-audit-workflow.sh).
# The guard asserts the centrally-owned invariants of the thin caller stub: the
# `uses:` reusable pinned to an approved channel, exactly `contents: read`
# permissions with no job-level override, the caller job being exactly the
# canonical `{ uses }` mapping (no execution-control keys), and the exact `on:`
# trigger surface (pull_request/push on `[main]` plus an empty merge_group).
# Each case drives the guard against a temporary fixture and asserts that
# accepted stubs pass and drifted stubs are REJECTED — a guard whose checks
# silently no-op is otherwise indistinguishable from a working one until drift
# reaches prod.
# No bats dependency: the guard is driven as a subprocess against temporary
# fixture workflows.
