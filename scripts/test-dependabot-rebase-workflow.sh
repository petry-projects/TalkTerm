# Regression guard: assert that dependabot-rebase.yml keeps the reliability- and
# security-critical invariants its own header marks as MUST-NOT-CHANGE. The file
# is a thin caller stub for the org reusable
# petry-projects/.github/.github/workflows/dependabot-rebase-reusable.yml; the
# rebase/merge-serialization logic lives there, not here.
#
# Context (Fleet Monitor #428): the single failing run tipping this workflow over
# the 10% threshold died on a *transient* GitHub-API TLS certificate error
# ("Post https://api.github.com/graphql: tls: failed to verify certificate")
# inside the reusable — infrastructure flakiness, not a caller defect, and not
# preventable here. The durable retry/backoff hardening belongs upstream in the
# reusable. What IS preventable in this repo is configuration drift in the stub:
# each invariant below, if lost, turns the workflow into a *hard* 100%-failure
# (e.g. dropping the permissions block breaks every reusable `gh` API call;
# repointing the `uses:` ref off its channel; dropping the App secrets breaks
# token generation). This guard locks those in, mirroring the convention of the
# sibling Fleet Monitor guards (test-pr-review-workflow.sh #374,
# test-ci-workflow.sh #380).
