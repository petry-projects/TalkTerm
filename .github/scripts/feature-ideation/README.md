# Feature Ideation — Scripts & Test Strategy

This directory contains the bash + Python helpers that back
`.github/workflows/feature-ideation.yml`. Every line of logic that used to
live inside the workflow's heredoc has been extracted here so it can be unit
tested with bats.

## Why this exists

The original workflow was a 500+ line YAML file with bash, jq, and GraphQL
queries inlined into a heredoc, plus a `direct_prompt:` block that asked
the BMAD Analyst (Mary) to call `gh api` and parse responses with no schema
or error handling. Every defect was discovered post-merge by reviewers.
The risks (R1–R11) are documented in the test architect's risk register —
search for "Murat" in the project history.

This refactor moves the parsing surface into testable units so failures are
caught **before UAT** instead of after.

## File map

| File | Purpose | Killed risk |
|------|---------|------------|
| `lib/gh-safe.sh` | Wraps every `gh` and `gh api graphql` call. Fails loud on auth, rate-limit, network, GraphQL errors envelope, or `data: null`. Replaces the original `2>/dev/null \|\| echo '[]'` swallow. | R1, R7, R8 |
| `lib/compose-signals.sh` | Validates JSON inputs before `jq --argjson` and assembles the canonical signals.json document. | R3, R4 |
| `lib/filter-bots.sh` | Configurable bot allowlist via `FEATURE_IDEATION_BOT_AUTHORS`. | R10 |
| `lib/date-utils.sh` | Cross-platform date arithmetic helpers. | R9 |
| `collect-signals.sh` | Orchestrator: drives all `gh` calls, composes signals.json, emits truncation warnings. | R1, R3, R4, R11 |
| `validate-signals.py` | JSON Schema 2020-12 validator for signals.json against `../schemas/signals.schema.json`. | R3 |
| `match-discussions.sh` | Deterministic Jaccard-similarity matcher between Mary's proposals and existing Ideas Discussions. Replaces the prose "use fuzzy matching" instruction. | R5, R6 |
| `discussion-mutations.sh` | `create_discussion`, `comment_on_discussion`, `add_label_to_discussion` wrappers with `DRY_RUN=1` audit-log mode. | Smoke testing |
| `lint-prompt.sh` | Scans every workflow file for unescaped `$()` / `${VAR}` inside `direct_prompt:` blocks (which YAML and `claude-code-action` pass verbatim instead of expanding). | R2 |

## Running the tests

```bash
# Install once
brew install bats-core shellcheck jq        # macOS
sudo apt-get install bats shellcheck jq     # Ubuntu (CI)
pip install jsonschema                      # Python schema validator

# Run everything
bats test/workflows/feature-ideation/

# Run a single suite
bats test/workflows/feature-ideation/gh-safe.bats

# Lint shell scripts
(cd .github/scripts/feature-ideation && \
  shellcheck -x collect-signals.sh lint-prompt.sh match-discussions.sh \
                 discussion-mutations.sh lib/*.sh)

# Lint the workflow's direct_prompt block
bash .github/scripts/feature-ideation/lint-prompt.sh
```

CI runs all of the above on every PR that touches this directory or the
workflow file. See `.github/workflows/feature-ideation-tests.yml`.

## DRY_RUN mode

To smoke-test the workflow on a fork without writing to GitHub Discussions:

1. Trigger via `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run: true`.
2. The `analyze` job will source `discussion-mutations.sh` with `DRY_RUN=1`,
   so every `create_discussion` / `comment_on_discussion` / `add_label_to_discussion`
   call writes a JSONL entry to `$DRY_RUN_LOG` instead of executing.
3. The dry-run log is uploaded as the `dry-run-log` artifact for human review.

## Schema as contract

`/.github/schemas/signals.schema.json` is the **producer/consumer contract**
between `collect-signals.sh` and Mary's prompt. Any change to the shape of
signals.json is a breaking change and must:

1. Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `collect-signals.sh`.
2. Update fixtures under `test/workflows/feature-ideation/fixtures/expected/`.
3. Update Mary's prompt in `feature-ideation.yml` if any field references move.

CI validates every fixture against the schema, and the workflow validates
the runtime output before handing it to Mary.
